# System Overview: Hackathon Todo Phase II – Full Stack Web Application

## Purpose
Transform an existing console-based todo application into a modern, multi-user, full-stack web application using spec-driven development. The system will provide secure, authenticated access to todo management functionality with proper user data isolation.

## Phase II Goals
- Implement full-stack architecture with Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend
- Integrate Better Auth for user authentication and JWT-based authorization
- Establish secure data isolation between users
- Enable CRUD operations for user-specific tasks
- Implement responsive UI with modern web standards

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16+ with App Router
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI
- **Database**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: SQLModel
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with JWT
- **Architecture**: Monorepo structure

## Feature List
1. User Registration and Login
2. Secure JWT-based authentication
3. User-specific task management (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
4. Task completion marking
5. Responsive web interface
6. Data ownership enforcement
7. Error handling and validation
8. Session management

## Constraints
- All code must be generated by AI agents (no manual coding)
- Strict adherence to defined technology stack
- Multi-user data isolation required
- All API endpoints must require authentication
- Spec-first development approach mandatory
